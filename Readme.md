## <a name="about-the-project"></a>‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

Welcome to **Football Sim**! This game is a senior project which is developed by 2 students **Yunus Emre Aslan** and **Onur √ñzdemir**. Our main goal wasn't to create the next big esports title, but to build something we learn on the way.

It's a simple, fast-paced arcade football game that's all about quick fun. We wanted to make sure you could enjoy it in a few different ways:

* **Online P2P Multiplayer:** Challenge a friend to a match online! We integrated **Steamworks** to make connecting as easy as possible.

**![Gameplay Demo](images/online_PVP.gif)**
* **Local PvP:** The classic couch co-op experience. Perfect for some friendly rivalry.

* **Player vs. AI:** For solo players, we've programmed a surprisingly competent AI opponent using **Behavior Trees**. See if you can outsmart our little machine!

At its heart, this is just a simple, fun game. We learned a ton making it, and we hope you have as much fun playing it as we did building it.
